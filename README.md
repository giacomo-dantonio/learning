## Project ideas

### A user's manual for introverts in a tech job

| Technologies | Difficulty | Effort | Status      |
|--------------|------------|--------|-------------|
| mdbook       | medium     | large  | in progress |

This is a book, not a software project.
Recently I started researching the topic of how to be happy as an introvert
in a software job, without having to give up your goals and ambitions.
I have collected some ideas from my research and have also
some own interesting ideas.

The next step is to write them down and share them with other.
While writing, I will probably have to do further and more detailed research.

I will write this using mdbook and upload it to github pages.

#### Status

Already started, but it will take some time.

### Photo manager

| Technologies        | Difficulty | Effort | Status          |
|---------------------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| Vue.js, ASP.Net, ML | medium     | large  | not started yet |

I have a lot of photos lying on a data storage in my home network.
They are accessible via smb. Since they are quite big, browsing through them
takes a long time and I struggle finding the photos,
when I am looking for something specific.

This project is a web application which uses machine learning
for picture classification. It consists of three parts.

The first part is a web application which allows the user to browse through
the folder structure of the photo storage.
The backend should resize the pictures to a smaller format and cache them
on the server side. It should provide endpoints for downloading
thumbnails, pictures in reduced size, or pictures in their original format.
The backend will resize and cache the pictures in one folder in advance,
before they are requested. E.g. as soon one picture from the folder is requested,
the other pictures in the same folder are resized and added to the cache.
It should use an LRU caching strategy.

The second part will let the user classify the photos manually with some tags
(multiple labels are possible).
It will also provide endpoints to search for pictures with a given label.
The web frondend needs to be able to assing labels to the pictures.
This should also be possible in batch (e.g. all the
picture in one folder get the same label). The labels needs to be persisted
on the backend. After a search, the server should cache the resized pictures
for the search results.

The third part is about using machine learning to automatically classify new photos.
A model will be trained using the labels manually entered by the user.
When new pictures are added to the storage, the application
will automatically assign labels to the new files. The user should be able
to remove or add some labels (also in batch) and retrain the model.

#### Status

Not started yet.

### Personal page and CV

| Technologies          | Difficulty | Effort | Status    |
|-----------------------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Html, CSS, Vanilla JS | easy       | small  | completed |

The idea of this project is a personal page hosted on github pages.
It should be structured similar to a CV, but each entry should link to
a detail page, containing more specific information.

#### Status

I completed this projects on two long train journeys
during Christmas 2021.

### Nonviolent communication

| Technologies        | Difficulty | Effort | Status          |
|---------------------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| Vue.js, TypeScript  | easy       | small  | not started yet |

This project is a wizard for writing a text using nonviolent communication.

Nonviolent communication is a technique for solving or mediating conflicts.
You write a message composed of 4 different stages (Observation, Feelings,
Needs, and Request).

The wizard has one step for each stage. Each step has a text form for entering
the actual message, an explanation of the step,
and some example messages (do and don't).

At end the complete message, consisting of all 4 stages, is shown in a
two columns table-layout. The rows correspond to the stages.
The first column contains the message, the second column the explanations
and the examples. The user has the chance to modify the messages in the first
column.

In the final step the complete message is shown. The user can either download
it as a text file, send it as an email, or copy it to the clipboard.

The project should be a static webpage hosted on github pages.

#### Status

I started with React and Bootstrap, but I did almost nothing.
I will start again from scratch with Vue.js.

### Marathon passing times

| Technologies                   | Difficulty | Effort | Status          |
|--------------------------------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| Vue.js, TypeScript, leafletjs  | medium     | medium | not started yet |

This project tells your family and friend at what time you will pass by
certain location when running a marathon, so that they can plan when to
go there and be ready to cheer you.

The user can choose between a certain number of predefined events (e.g. Bremen,
Hamburg, Berlin, Rome, Amsterdam, etc.). Once they've chosen an event,
the route of the race will be shown in a map. The user enters their pace
(in minutes per kilometer) and their starting time.
The starting time may also be pre-filled, if the application already knowns it.

By clicking on a point on the route, the application will show the time
the runner will pass by, assuming they run uniformly with the given pace.

The application shows a link. The user can copy this link and send it to
their family and friends (e.g. via WhatsApp).
Opening the link will show the application with the settings
chosen by the runner (race, pace and starting time).

The application should be responsive and work well on mobile devices.

#### Status

I started it with Elm, and did also quite a bit of progress, then I stopped
working on it. Now I forgot almost everything about Elm.
I will rewrite this with Vue.js.

### Tides prediction

| Technologies                   | Difficulty | Effort | Status   |
|--------------------------------|------------|--------|----------|
| React, Rust, WebAssembly       | high       | medium | finished |

This is a finished project (the code could use some polishing, though).
It is a static website for predicting the sea level
at some locations in Germany, based on the time series of the past 30 days.
It uses rust + wasm for doing the statistical regression. It uses React for
the frontend.

The intention was to learn about rust and webassembly.
At the same time I also wanted to learn about tides prediction
and Fourier transform. Looking back, it was too much new stuff at once.

I use the REST API of the german site [Pegelonline](https://www.pegelonline.wsv.de/)
to fetch the water levels at given locations in germany for the past 30 days.

At the time I didn't know how to use the Fourier transform. So I used it
to interpolate the time series values. This was clearly useless, since the
resulting function is periodic and overfits.
When I realized that, I changed the strategy. I now use linear least squares
optimization to fit some harmonic constituents to the time series values.
This works better and the prediction are somewhat accurate for the next 2 days.
But still, I'm not satisfied with that.

The lesson learned here is that oceanography is difficult.

#### Status

I'm not satisfied with how the project turned out, but I'm not going to work
on this anymore.

### Nintendo Hire-Me challenge

| Technologies | Difficulty | Effort | Status |
|--------------|------------|--------|--------|
| Rust         | very high  | large  | paused |

This is my attempt at solving
[Nintendo's *Hire Me* challenge](https://www.nerd.nintendo.com/files/HireMe)
using Rust. When I did this, I had just started learning Rust, so my code
may not be quite idiomatic.

I came up with a strategy to solve the puzzle, and documented it partially.
I also implemented it, but got stuck at the last step.
I would probably have to think of a better strategy. But, for the moment,
I stopped working on it.

#### Status

On hold. I enjoyed the challenge, so I will come back to it, when I feel like. 
Probably not in the near future, though.
